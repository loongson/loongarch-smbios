== 1. Symbols
* *DQWORD* +
128-bits (In the SMBIOS specification, WORD is 16-bits, DWORD is 32-bits, and QWORD is 64-bits).

== 2. Vendor Name register and CPU Name register
The LoongArch CPUs designed by Loongson have two registers representing Machine Vendor Name and CPU Name, both of which are DQWORD-format NUL-terminated ASCII string values, located at offsets 0x10 and 0x20 of the IOCSR space respectively.

== 3. LoongArch Type 44 Processor Additional Information
The information in this structure defines the processor additional information in case SMBIOS type 4 is not sufficient to describe processor characteristics. The SMBIOS type 44 structure has a reference handle field to link back to the related SMBIOS type 4 structure. There may be multiple SMBIOS type 44 structures linked to the same SMBIOS type 4 structure. For example, when cores are not identical in a processor, SMBIOS type 44 structures describe different core-specific information. +

SMBIOS type 44 defines the standard header for the processor-specific block (see 7.45.1), while the contents of processor-specific data are maintained by processor architecture workgroups or vendors in separate documents (see 7.45.2).

=== 3.1 Standard Processor Additonal Information (Type 44) structure
The following is the standard header of SMBIOS type 44 defined in SMBIOS specification section 7.45.

|Handle, or instance number, associated with the structure

|04h
|Referenced Handle
|WORD

|Varies (Y)
|Varies
|Processor-specific block (See section 3.2)

=== 3.2 Standard Processor-specific Block
Processor-specific block is the standard header of processor-specific data as defined in SMBIOS section 7.45.1.

|00h
|Revision
|WORD
|0100h (v1.00)
|Revision of LoongArch Processor-specific Block structure. +
Bits [15:8] Major revision, bits [7:0] Minor revision.

|02h
|Block Length
|BYTE
|28h (40d)
|Length of Processor-specific Data

|03h

|BYTE
|0
|Reserved.

|04h
|Machine Vendor ID
|DQWORD
|Varies
|The manufacturer vendor ID of the processor. +
It is semantically equivalent to the value at the offset 0x10 of the IOCSR space on a Loongson CPU.

|14h
|CPU ID
|DQWORD
|Varies
|The CPU ID used for this LoongArch processor manufacturer to mark different CPU types or CPU instances. +
It is semantically equivalent to the value at the offset 0x20 of the IOCSR space on a Loongson CPU.

|24h
|ISA extensions support
|DWORD
|Bit-field
|The bit field [3:0] indicates support for the existing LoongArch standard ISA extensions. It is modeled after the LoongArch EUEN register (CSR 0x2), and meaning of each bit is the same as defined for the EUEN register. +
Setting a bit in this field indicates that this system supports the corresponding ISA extension.
