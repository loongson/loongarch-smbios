/**
 * This is an empty stylesheet.
 * We use a JS switcher to rendere the contents with any of the available asciidoctor skins.
 * The JS switcher comes from https://github.com/darshandsoni/asciidoctor-skins.
 * This file is necessary, otherwise Asciidoctor will use the default theme.
 * We just leave this CSS file empty to avoid redundant rendering.
